# MSCT2020_Hackathon
 A small program created by BAAARCODE and I for the 2020 MCST Hackathon. The rules of the hackathon being to create a program which would fulfill one of the general topics we were provided. This submission earned us first place in the "Health" Category of the hackathon. The program functions to assess the risk of contracting COVID that you take going to meet with an amount of people you input in your zip code. It does this by using the COVID Act Now API and taking information from their data to put it in a simpler form made specific to the user. The API work and computation was done by me, and the UI was completely done by BAAARCODE.
This program can be imported dircetly into eclipse and will continue to function (lest the COVID Act Now API were to be brought down or changed).
