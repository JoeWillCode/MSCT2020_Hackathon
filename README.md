# MSCT2020_Hackathon
 A small program created by BAAARCODE and I for the 2020 MCST Hackathon. This submission earned us first place in the "Health" Category of the hackathon. The program assesses your risk of contracting COVID given an amount of people you have made contact with and the zip code you met them in. It accomplishes this by using the data from the COVID Act Now API and calculating the chance someone you met in that area had COVID, then assessing the likelihood of you getting COVID from them if you had, or had not been wearing a mask. The API work and computation was done by me, and the UI was completely done by BAAARCODE.
